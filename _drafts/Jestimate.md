If you are looking for a powerful way to visualize geographic data then you should learn to use interactive Choropleth maps. A Choropleth map represents statistical data through various shading patterns or symbols on predetermined geographic areas such as countries, states or counties. Static Choropleth maps are useful for showing one view of data, but an interactive Choropleth map is much more powerful and allows the user to select the data they prefer to view. 

The interactive chart below provides details on San Francisco single family homes sales. The chart breaks down the single family home sales by Median Sales Price, Minimum Income Required, Average Sales Price, Average Sales Price Per Square Foot, Average Square Footage and Number of Sales all by neighborhood and year (10 years of data).
