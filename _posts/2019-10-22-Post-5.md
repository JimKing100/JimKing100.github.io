If you are looking to create powerful data visualizations then you should consider using Bokeh.  In an earlier article, I demonstrated how to create an interactive geographic map using Bokeh (click here).  This article will take it a step further and demonstrate how to use an interactive map with a data table and text fields organized using a Bokeh layout to create an interactive dashboard for displaying data.  I will also demonstrate several methods for debugging the code which also provides some insight into the structures used in Bokeh.

First, let's take a look at the finished product which appeared in the article "[Look Out Zillow Here Comes Jestimate!][1]":

If you'd like to understand how to develop a similar visualization follow along as I step you through the process.

### A Word About the Code

All the code, data and associated files for the project can be accessed at my [GitHub][2].  The project is separated into two Colab notebooks.  One runs the linear regression model (creating the data for the visualization) and the other produces the interactive visualization using a Bokeh server on Heroku.
