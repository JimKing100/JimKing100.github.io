If you are looking to create powerful data visualizations then you should consider using Bokeh.  In an earlier article, I demonstrated how to create an interactive geographic map using Bokeh ([Click here][1]).  This article will take it a step further and demonstrate how to use an interactive map with a data table and text fields organized using a Bokeh layout to create an interactive dashboard for displaying data.  I will also demonstrate several methods for debugging the code which also provides some insight into the structures used in Bokeh.

First, let's take a look at the finished product which appeared in the article "[Look Out Zillow Here Comes Jestimate!][2]":

If you'd like to understand how to develop a similar visualization follow along as I step you through the process.

### A Word About the Code

All the code, data and associated files for the project can be accessed at my [GitHub][3].  The project is separated into two Colab notebooks.  One runs the linear regression model (creating the data for the visualization) and the other produces the interactive visualization using a Bokeh server on Heroku.

### Installs and Imports

Let's start with the installs and imports you will need for the graphs. Pandas, numpy and math are standard Python libraries used to clean and wrangle the data. The geopandas, json and bokeh imports are libraries needed for the mapping.

I work in Colab and needed to install fiona and geopandas.  While you are developing the application in Colab, you will need to keep these installs in the code.  However, once you start testing with the Bokeh server you will need to comment out these installs as Bokeh chokes on the magic commands (!pip install...).

```
# Install fiona - need to comment out for transfer to live site.
# Turn on for running in a notebook
%%capture
!pip install fiona

# Install geopandas - need to comment out for tranfer to live site.
# Turn on for running in a notebook
%%capture
!pip install geopandas
```

```
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import math

import geopandas
import json

from bokeh.io import output_notebook, show, output_file
from bokeh.plotting import figure
from bokeh.models import GeoJSONDataSource, LinearColorMapper, ColorBar, NumeralTickFormatter
from bokeh.palettes import brewer

from bokeh.io.doc import curdoc
from bokeh.models import Slider, HoverTool, Select, TapTool, CustomJS, ColumnDataSource, TableColumn, DataTable, CDSView, GroupFilter
from bokeh.layouts import widgetbox, row, column, gridplot
from bokeh.models.widgets import TextInput
```

### Preliminary Code

As the focus of this article is on the creation of interactive dashboard, I will skip the following steps which are covered in detail in my previous article ([Click here][1]).

1. Preparing the Mapping Data and GeoDataFrame
2. Creating the JSON Data for the GeoJSONDataSource
3. The Color Bar
4. The Hover Tool

### Data Loading, Cleaning and Wrangling

I will briefly discuss the data used in the application, you can view the full cleaning and wrangling [here][4] if you are interested.

There are two pieces of data used in the application:  neighborhood data used to show aggregate statistics for 2018 for each neighborhood and display data for each individual property sold in 2018 produced by the linear regression code in my article "[Look Out Zillow Here Comes Jestimate!][2]"
