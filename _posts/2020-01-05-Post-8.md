I was looking for an interesting project for a recent Hackathon and decided to create a Web app that scraped job listings from Indeed.com, processed them using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and provided a summary of the total number of jobs, the average salary range and the top 10 technical skills for four broad tech positions in the top 20 tech cities in the U.S.

The four broad tech positions – Data Scientist, Web Developer, UX Designer and iOS Developer – actually include all positions related to that job title. So, a Web Developer includes Web Developer, Front End Engineer, PHP Developer and many other titles deemed by Indeed.com to be Web Developer-related positions.

The top 20 tech cities were determined by calculating the top 20 metro areas(MSAs) in the U.S. based on the highest average mean wage for computer and mathematical occupations. The Indeed.com search takes a 25 mile radius from the city, so the results include surrounding areas of the cities.

Take a look at the finished product:
