What are the most poplar Instacart grocery products ordered early in the day?  What are the most popular Instacart grocery products ordered late in the day?  Early in the day, customers bought healthy items such as granola bars, while later in the day customers bought less healthy items such as ice cream!

Instacart released a public dataset, "The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017", containing anonymized data with a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.

The data set can be accessed as follows: _“The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, Accessed from https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 on 7/26/2019._  Questions: open_data@instacart.com.

One challenge was to graph the most popular products by hour of day ordered to find the top user purchases early in the day and late in the day.

Here is the completed chart:
