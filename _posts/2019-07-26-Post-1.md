What are the most popular Instacart grocery products ordered early in the day?  What are the most popular Instacart grocery products ordered late in the day?  Early in the day, customers bought healthy items such as granola bars, while later in the day customers bought less healthy items such as ice cream!

Instacart released a public dataset, "The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017", containing anonymized data with a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.

The data set can be accessed as follows: _“The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, Accessed from https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 on 7/26/2019._  Questions: open_data@instacart.com.

One challenge was to graph the most popular products by hour of day ordered to find the top user purchases early in the day and late in the day.

Here is the completed chart:

### Steps to Create the Graph

Here is the high level view for creating the graph.

#### Step 1 - Load the Data

The data can be downloaded as a .zip file containing 12 .csv files using the following commands in Colab notebook.  The files are downloaded to the local notebook directory.

#### Step 2 - Merge the Data

Begin by merging the **order_products_prior** with **order_products_train** to create on **order_products** dataframe, then merge it with **product** and **orders** to gain the full base data.

#### Step 3 - Create a Top Products Dataframe

Create a new dataframe **top_products** with all products with orders greater than 2,900 and merge it with **product** to get a full subset of top products.

#### Step 4 - Create a Dataframe with Products Grouped by Hour of Day and Add Count and Percent Columns

Create a **product_orders_by_hour** dataframe grouped by product_id and order_hour_of_day.  Add a sum column to count the number of orders each hour for each product and a percentage column to represent the percent of orders the sum equaled.

#### Step 5 - Create a Dataframe with the Mean Hour for Each Product

For each product in **product_orders_by_hour**, group by the average hour _sum(order hour x # orders for hour)/total orders_.  This creates the **mean_hour** dataframe containing the product_id and mean_hour for all the products.

#### Step 6 - Sort the Mean Hour for Each Product to Create the Early and Late Lists

By sorting the **mean_hour** dataframe in ascending order and taking the top 25, you get the **early_list** dataframe containing the top 25 early products and by sorting in descending order and taking the top 25, you get the **late_list** dataframe containing the top 25 late products.  Pull out the product names to create the **early_product_names** list and the **late_product_names** lists for the legends.  Merge the early and late dataframes with **product_orders_by_hour** to get the **early_pct** and **late_pct** dataframes for plotting.

#### Step 7 - Plot the Results

Use **early_pct** and **late_pct** dataframes to plot the Order Hour of the Day against the Percent of Orders by Product.  Use the **early_product_names** and **late_product_name** for the two legends.
