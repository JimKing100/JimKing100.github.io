A content based recommender system works with user provided data to generate recommendations for the user.  Recommender systems can be used to personalize information for a user and are commonly used to recommend movies, books, restaurants, and other products and services.

Using the Marijuana Recommendation System below (or at the link [here][1]), we are going to use user selected effects and flavors to recommend five marijuana strains from a list of over 2,300 marijuana strains.  In our case, the product is marijuana and the features are a list of effects and flavors.

### A Word About the Code

All the code, data and associated files for the project can be accessed at my [GitHub][2].  The README file provides details of the repo directory and files.

### The TF-IDF Model Using k-NN

TF-IDF refers to Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.  TF is simply the frequency a word appears in a document.  IDF is the inverse of the document frequency in the whole corpus of documents.  The idea behind the TF-IDF is to dampen the effect of high-frequency words in determing the importance of an item (document).
