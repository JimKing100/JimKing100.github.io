A decision tree is a popular and powerful method for making predictions in data science.  Decision trees also form the foundation for other popular ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting and gradient boosting.  Its popularity is due to the simplicity of the technique making it easy to understand.  We are going to implement a decision tree from scratch and use it for several classification problems.  First, lets start with a simple classification example to explain how a decision tree works.

A Simple Example

Let's say we have 10 rectangles of various widths and heights.  Five of the rectangles are purple and five are yellow.  The data looks like this:
