While the complete code for predicting fantasy football points is quite involved, let's take a closer look at the core RNN-LSTM code using one player as an example.  We are going to use Aaron Rodgers, the quarterback for the Green Bay Packers.  Aaron is an excellent test case as he started his NFL career in 2005 providing 15 years of data.  In addition, he did not suffer any significant injuries during the 2019 season.

The initial call to the RNN-LSTM prediction function **lstm_pred** occurs in the function named **main**.  The input to the function consists of:

**player** = 'Aaron Rodgers' This is the name of the player  
**n_periods** = 16  In this example we are beginning at the start of the season and predicting all 16 games of the 2019 season  
**col** = 85 In the dataframe containing the actual fantasy football points Aaron's 2005 data begins in the 85th column  

```
pred_points = lstm_pred(player, n_periods, col)
```
Using these three inputs, let's take a close look at **lstm_pred**.

```
def lstm_pred(p, np, c):
    series = make_series(p, c)
    X = series.values
    supervised = timeseries_to_supervised(X, 1)
    supervised_values = supervised.values

    # Split data into train and test-sets
    train, test = supervised_values[0:-np], supervised_values[-np:]

    # Transform the scale of the data
    scaler, train_scaled, test_scaled = scale(train, test)

    # Fit the model
    lstm_model = fit_lstm(train_scaled, 1, 100, 1)

    # Forecast the entire training dataset to build up state for forecasting
    train_reshaped = train_scaled[:, 0].reshape(len(train_scaled), 1, 1)
    lstm_model.predict(train_reshaped, batch_size=1)

    # Walk-forward validation on the test data
    yhat_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(test_scaled)):
        # Make one-step forecast
        X, y = test_scaled[i, 0:-1], test_scaled[i, -1]
        yhat = forecast_lstm(lstm_model, 1, X)
        # Invert scaling
        yhat = invert_scale(scaler, X, yhat)
        # Sum the weekly forecasts
        yhat_sum = yhat_sum + yhat

    return yhat_sum

```
