While the complete code for predicting fantasy football points is quite involved, let's take a closer look at the core RNN-LSTM code using one player as an example.  We are going to use Aaron Rodgers, the quarterback for the Green Bay Packers.  Aaron is an excellent test case as he started his NFL career in 2005 providing 15 years of data.  In addition, he did not suffer any significant injuries during the 2019 season.

The call to the RNN-LSTM prediction occurs in the function named **main**.

```
pred_points = lstm_pred(player, n_periods, col)
```
