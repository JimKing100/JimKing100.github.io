As someone with expertise in both real estate and data science, I’ve always been fascinated by Zillow’s Zestimate.  In the spirit of competition I’ve developed Jim’s estimate or Jestimate!

The following interactive map contains 2018 home sales in San Francisco by neighborhood.  Click on the neighborhood and then click on a home in the data table to see the Jestimate results versus the actual sales price.
