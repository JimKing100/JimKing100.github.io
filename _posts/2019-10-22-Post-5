If you are looking to create powerful data visualizations then you should consider using Bokeh.  In an earlier article, I demonstrated how to create an interactive geographic map using Bokeh (click here).  This article will take it a step further and demonstrate how to use an interactive map with a data table and text fields organized using a Bokeh layout to create an interactive dashboard for displaying data.  I will also demonstrate several methods for debugging the code and gaining some insight into the structures used in Bokeh.
