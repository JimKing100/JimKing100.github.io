I'm an aspiring data scientist with a background in software development and real estate.  I have over 18 years in software development and am the co-inventor of a software patent.  I also have over 18 years experience in real estate.  I have a BA in Computer Science and an MBA in Finance.  I'm located in beautiful Marin County just north of San Francisco.
